            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Kind Reception I have upon all Occaſions met with from your Lordſhip, Emboldens me to lay the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Papers at your Feet; not
<pb facs="tcp:50560:3"/>that I pretend to offer any thing worth your Lordſhips Favour, your thorough Experience into, and Exquiſite Skill in whatever relates to <hi>Chymiſtry,</hi> makes me too Conſcious to my ſelf how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle this deſerves your Patronage and Protection.</p>
            <p>But ſince I have no other way left me of acknowledging the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Obligations I lye under to your Lordſhip, I rather chooſe to run the hazard of my Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation on this account, then paſs off the Stage with the Guilt of Ingratitude upon me, who muſt ever attribute all I now enjoy at Home to the Care and Goodneſs of your Lordſhip.</p>
            <p>Accept then my Lord, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, the Sincere, though
<pb facs="tcp:50560:3"/>weak Endeavours of my Declin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Years, and judge not my Reſpect and Duty by the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Performance. The Honour of your Lordſhips Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation will Fortifie me againſt Cenſure; And however defective I may ſeem to have been, yet I have ſtill the hopes that I may by this means Incite others to greater and nobler Attempts of this kind, and put them upon a deeper Search into the more cloſe Receſſes of this ſo <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſeful, but Myſterious Art.</p>
            <p>And here, my Lord, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not omit, with humble Submiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, Suggeſting to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, how happy wou'd the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Age be, as well as Poſterity, if ſo great a Genius as your Lordſhip wou'd pleaſe to borrow
<pb facs="tcp:50560:4"/>ſome few Minutes, from your other more weighty Affairs, to Collect the Curious Obſervations you have made in <hi>Cymiſtry,</hi> and Communicate them to the World; What might we not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from ſuch Indefatigable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, and ſo great a Capacity! Even the Admirable Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi> where he alive, might with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſee himſelf out-done, in what was his Chiefeſt Darling and Miſtris.</p>
            <p>But I ſhall wave the Enlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on this Subject, leſt by at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to give your juſt Praiſes I ſhould leſſen that Character, which all who have the Honour to know your Lordſhip, muſt confeſs you truly deſerve.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>I Need not Enlarge my ſelf in the Uſe of <hi>Chymiſtry,</hi> and the great Improvements made by it among the Affairs of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; it has been done by many and better Hands; but in <hi>Phyſick</hi> it is of that vaſt Extent, that every <hi>Age,</hi> for ſome Hundreds of Years, has Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred to its Growth; and with that Succeſs, that there are few <hi>Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> of Note, in any of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, whether <hi>Mineral, Vegetable,</hi> or <hi>Animal,</hi> but have received ſome Advantage by it: The common Approbation of the Learned has not only render'd it unqueſtionable, but its Uſe has made it one of the chief Props of <hi>Phyſick;</hi> and without doubt it is capable of being more
<pb facs="tcp:50560:6"/>Improv'd, and will be in ſo Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious a Subject as Nature it ſelf.</p>
            <p>But to the Matter in hand, I free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acknowledge the Collection I have made is not New, nor can I ſay I deſign'd it, being always per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded it was the beſt way to place thoſe ſeveral Proceſſes I have added out of my own Store, under ſuch General Heads they naturally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd to, in ſuch manner that it might make up an intire or compleat <hi>Body of Chymiſtry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the Proceſſes which are not mine, but have been Extant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I have made uſe of them as things neceſſary to my Deſign, but with ſome Improvement; becauſe I have joyn'd new Obſervations about the way and manner of working them, which I have found not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convenient, but ſometimes obſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary, by the Experience of near Fourty Years, wherein I have been a Diligent Operator in Chymiſtry.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:50560:6"/>
            <p>I have divided the whole into Two Courſes, as may be ſeen at the end of this Book, to ſave ſuch Gentlemen as are Curious in Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Philoſophy, the Writing or Tranſcribing Proceſſes. I have ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much Enlarged the Courſes, and have ſo order'd it, that the whole may be Finiſh'd in the ſpace of one Year.</p>
            <p>I have all along ſtudied Brevity, and therefore have rejected thoſe things which are frivolous, or of little Uſe: And my Anſwer to them who find Fault with the Stile is, Perſpicuity was more my En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour than Ornament; thinking it ſufficient in Matters of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, if I can be underſtood with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any difficulty.</p>
            <p>I ſhall ſay nothing of the Proceſſes I have annexed, but leave them to the Publick; only taking notice, That I have briefly given the <hi>Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> and <hi>Doſe</hi> of each Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, that there might be nothing wanting to render it Compleat.</p>

                  <p>GOLD, the Pureſt of all Metals, is by Nature Generated of a moſt Pure Fixed ☿, and a ſmall quantity of clean fix'd Sulphur, of moſt pure Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which tingeth the ☿: That it is moſt Mercurial, appears by its eaſie Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with, and Reception of pure ☿; that this ☿ is Fixed, and clear from all Operations upon it by Fire; that the Sulphur of it is tinging, is manifeſt by this, That joyned rightly with pure ☿, it transforms, or changeth its Colour, into a moſt pure Red; that it hath grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter quantity of ☿ than Sulphur, is clear from its ready admiſſion, and reception of ☿.</p>
                  <p>It is a moſt Noble Subject for Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, in the hands of an Expert Artiſt; witneſs Dr. <hi>Anthony's Aurum Potabile.</hi>

                     <head>Aurum Potabile, as I Prepared it for the Chief Phyſician of a Great Prince, 1692.</head>
                     <p>I Diſſolved four Ounces of <hi>Gold</hi> (pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified as before) in one Pound of Bezoart. Spirit of Nitre, and drew the Spirit from the Gold in a Heat of Sand, return'd the ſame Spirit upon the <hi>Gold,</hi> and Diſtill'd it off again. I made the Second Cohobation with the ſame Spirit, as alſo the Third, Fourth, and Fifth Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hobation, with one Pound of New Spirit of Nitre Bezoart. And likewiſe the Sixth, Seventh and Eighth Cohobation, with one Pound more of New Bezoart. Spirit of Nitre.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt I was doing this, I made the Oil of Chalk thus: I took half a Pound of clean Chalk, ſcrap'd it, and dry'd it before the Fire in an Earthen Diſh, then
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:50560:15"/>put it into a Cucurbit, and pour upon it, by little and little, one Pound and half of Spirit of Nitre, which diſſolved the greater part of the Chalk. I Filtred the Diſſolution, put it into a Retort, and Diſtill'd it in Sand; that which Diſtill'd from it came off almoſt Inſipid; I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd that which remain'd in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort, in part of the Flegm which I drew off from it; it ſet new Feces; I Filter'd the Diſſolution again, and Filter'd, and Exſiccated, as before; I diſſolv'd it again in the Flegm which came off, it then to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally diſſolv'd, without any Feces; I Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiccated it again, and mix'd of it, and the aforeſaid Calx of <hi>Gold, ana,</hi> and ground them extreamly well together in a clean Marble Mortar, with a Glaſs Peſtle.</p>
                     <p>I then divided the whole Matter into equal parts, and with one Part I ground double its weight of purified Salt Peter, and with the other part treble its weight of Sal Armoniack Sublimed twice, and equal its weight of <hi>Stellate Regulus Martis,</hi> in ſubtil Powder; each Parcel being well mixt by a long Trituration; I put this Mixture in a Retort; placed it in a Sand Furnace, made gradual Fire under it for eight Hours, and kept it two Hours lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in the moſt extream degree of Fire; the Sal Armoniack roſe into the neck of the Retort, ſo much Impregnated with
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:50560:16"/>the Sulphur of Gold, that it was as red as Blood.</p>
                     <p>The other Mixture of Golden Calx and Nitre, I put into a red hot Crucible, by a quarter of a Spoonful at a time, ceaſing one Minute between each Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection; when all was in, I gave it a ſtrong melting Fire for three Hours, and before it was cold, made it into Powder in a clean, warm, Iron Mortar, and put it preſently into a clean and dry Cucur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, and put ſo much highly Rectified Tartaris'd Spirit of Wine upon it, as to appear four Fingers above the Mixture, then inverted another Glaſs into the Mouth of the Cucurbit, to make it a Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culating Veſſel, and let it ſtand in a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering Heat for twenty four Hours, in which time the Spirit of Wine was well tinged, I decanted it, and put on more Spirit of Wine, and let it ſtand twenty four Hours in the ſame manner as before, and ſo did the third time, but then it took but little Tincture.</p>
                     <p>I ordered the Sublimed and Impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Sal Armoniack, with Spirit of Wine, as I did the other; I put the Tinctures of each parcel apart, into Cucurbits, adap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Heads and Receivers to them, and in a gentle Heat drew off the Spirit of Wine, not leaving above eight Ounces in each Glaſs, both the Tinctures were deeply tinged, of which I gave a part to the Gentleman that Imployed me, who ſeem'd
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:50560:16"/>to receive them with great Satisfaction, and Gratified me generouſly.</p>
                     <p>The Operation of both the Tinctures are Diaphoretick, and eſteem'd great Cordials.</p>
                     <p>Their Doſe from five to twenty five, or thirty Drops, in a Glaſs of Spaniſh, or French Wine, or any other Vehicle, even to Water.</p>
                     <p>They are good in <hi>Cachexies, Conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions,</hi> all ſorts of <hi>Fevers,</hi> and to ſuch whoſe Bodies have been over-charged with <hi>Mercurials.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>N. B.</hi> The ſeveral Cohobations are to Subtilize the <hi>Gold;</hi> the Calcin'd and Purify'd <hi>Chalk</hi> is mixt with it for a Bole, which by that Purification is Subtiliz'd ſufficiently to mix with the Minute Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the <hi>Gold,</hi> the better to make it give forth its <hi>Sulphur</hi> to the <hi>Menſtruum.</hi> In its Fuſion with the <hi>Salt Peter;</hi> it emits its pure <hi>Sulphur</hi> into the <hi>Nitre,</hi> the more groſs part falling to the bottom in a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Its being Projected into the Crucible, in ſo little a quantity at a time, and ſo leaſurely, is to prevent its boyling over, which it would do by too haſty Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections.</p>
                     <p>Its being mixt with clean <hi>Sal Armoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ack,</hi> is to cauſe its pure <hi>Sulphur</hi> to ſublime,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:50560:17"/>it being the nature of <hi>Sal Armoniack</hi> to carry up Metallick Sulphurs.</p>
                     <p>The Tinctures are taken each by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that the Phyſician may uſe them alone, or mixt, as he pleaſes.</p>
                     <p>When we reduced the Gold, we had three Ounces, three Scruples, two Drams, and five Grains; of a little paler Colour than it was at our firſt Diſſolution of it.</p>

And in <hi>London,</hi> it is well known, that all the Old Iron which is gathered by many poor People, are ſold to the Copperas-Houſes at <hi>Rotherhith</hi> and <hi>Deptford,</hi> which they boil up with the Diſſolution of the <hi>Marchaſite Pyritis,</hi> or <hi>Fire-ſtone.</hi>

                  <p>In Colour the <hi>Hungarian</hi> and <hi>Dantzick</hi> are Green, but the firſt is the deeper: The <hi>Roman</hi> or <hi>Cyprus</hi> is Blue; The <hi>Engliſh</hi> is yet of a Paler Green than either. The <hi>White</hi> takes its Name from its Colour. There is alſo a Red Vitriol, which is that of <hi>Germany,</hi> and yet of no great
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:50560:71"/>Uſe among us. It is ſuppos'd to be a Green Vitriol, Calcin'd by a Subterranean Heat.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. XII.</hi> Of Sulphur, or Common Brimſtone.</head>
                  <p>IT is brought to us from <hi>Italy,</hi> and ſome of the <hi>Weſt-India-Iſlands,</hi> being Generated of a Fat, Reſinous Subſtance, full of an Acid, Vitriolick Spirit, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by its Spirit made with a Glaſs Veſſel, reſembling the ſhape of a Bell, from which it takes the Name of <hi>Spirit of Sulphur per Campanum,</hi> differing very little from that of Vitriol.</p>
                  <p>We have it in three Forms, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Sulphur Vive,</hi> which come to us as it is dug out of the Earth, and valued at the deareſt Price of the Three, for no other Reaſon, but that it is leſs Vendible than the other.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Mineral Rough Brimſtone,</hi> which by Melting is Separated from a great deal of Inſignificant Earth, which the Sulphur contained.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That caſt into ſmall Rolls, commonly Sold by Grocers and Chand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, which is ſaid to be mix'd with Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin, or ſome other Bituminous Subſtance,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:50560:78"/>and by Experience found to be the worſt ſort for the making either Flowers or Oil; the rough Mineral Brimſtone is the beſt, for the aforeſaid Uſes, as having leſs Earth than <hi>Sulphur Vive,</hi> and not being mixt with any Heterogeneous Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle.</p>

                     <p>TO make this to any Advantage, it muſt be Sublimed in an Arched Room, inſtead of a Glaſs or Earthen Receiver, and one, two, or three Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Weight (according to the Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the Room) may be put in at a time. You muſt have a great thick Iron Pan, called a Tampin, to put the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur in, which muſt be placed immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately over the Grate, and about a third part of the Diameter of the Tampin left open above its brim, to ſuffer the Fumes to come into the Arch where they Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſe into Flowers: The Arch ought to be at leaſt eighteen, or twenty two In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches thick; and that Cramp'd together with Iron, to reſiſt the Force of the Fumes.</p>
                     <pb n="138" facs="tcp:50560:79"/>
                     <p>If you deſign your Furnace to Sublime one hundred Weight of Flowers at a time, your Pan muſt be capable of hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one hundred and a quarter; your Arch five Foot high, three Foot broad, and five Foot long; and its inſide and floor to be ſet with glas'd Tiles: In the end, or ſide of the Furnace, you muſt have a Door, which muſt be two Foot ſquare; it muſt be ſtrongly Barricado'd, and a little Hole in it of a quarter of an Inch Diameter, which muſt be exactly ſtop'd with a Plugg, by which you may know when all is Sublim'd: For when you think the Operation is almoſt at an end, pull out the Plugg, and if the Fume come not forcibly out, the Operation is over, but if you find a ſtrong Fume, with ſome Noiſe, continue the Fire till all is over.</p>
                     <p>Then let all cool twenty four Hours, before the Door is opened, and then go in, and with a Wing, or clean Bruſh, wipe the Flowers into a heap, and take them out for uſe.</p>
                     <p>It may be made in leſs quantity in Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of another Form: A Deſcription of both you will ſee in the Preceding Plate.</p>

                  <p>IT is a Juicy Combuſtible Mineral Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, confiſting of Sulphur, and Corroſive Salts; of which there are three ſorts, <hi>viz. Yellow Arſnick,</hi> called <hi>Orpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Red Arſnick,</hi> called <hi>Sandarach,</hi> and the <hi>White,</hi> properly called <hi>Arſnick.</hi> It is made of the Red, by mixing equal parts of <hi>Sandarach,</hi> and <hi>Common Salt,</hi> and Subliming them together.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>White</hi> is moſt us'd in Phyſick, the <hi>Yellow</hi> leſs, and the <hi>Red</hi> very little. It is one of the moſt Pernicious of Poiſons, and ſo great an Enemy to the Balſam of Life, that it produceth ſtrange Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, as Convulſions, Swoonings, Gripes, Vomitings, Palpitation of the Heart, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable Heat and Thirſt, with Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the part where it comes.</p>

                     <head type="sub">To Sublime Arſnick.</head>
                     <p>THE common way is to mix equal Parts of Arſnick and Salt decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate, in fine Powder; Put them in a Matras, in a Sand Furnace, within a Chimney, ſtopping the Mouth of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tras looſly with Cotton, or Paper; make a gentle Fire, which increaſe gradually to the third Degree, and ſo keep till all is Sublimed: Six or Seven Hours time will be ſufficient to raiſe the Mixture of half a Pound of each. This you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat as often as you think convenient, every Sublimation ſeparating the light, fuzy Flowers, and taking only the Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaline part. This Sublimation cleanſes it, but in my Opinion makes it the more Corroſive, by carrying up ſome of the ſharp Spirit of Salt with it.</p>

                     <p>TAke of the aforeſaid Sublimate one Pound, put it in a Crucible; ſet it in a melting Furnace, in ſuch a Fire as will juſt keep it melting, where con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:50560:86"/>it for two Hours, in which time a great deal of the moſt Corroſive Poiſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Part will be Exhal'd.</p>
                     <p>Let it cool, and that which remains in the Crucible make into Powder, and grind it with equal its weight of fine Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of Iron; ſet them in a Sand Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace to Sublime, as you did before, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the ſame Degree of Fire, and ſpace of time, proportionable to the quantity; Repeat this Operation twice more, every time ſeparating the light Flower, and then you have a Sublimed Arſnick, pretty well freed from its Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſive Poiſon, and fit for farther Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: Some have ventur'd to give the Infuſion of this Arſnick inwardly, and ſay it is a great Antidote againſt Poiſon.</p>

The <hi>Sal Gem</hi> we have from the <hi>North-Eaſt-Countries,</hi> as <hi>Poland, &amp;c.</hi> where there are large Rocks of it; the Fountain-Salt out of <hi>Cheſhire</hi> and <hi>Worceſterſhire,</hi> and that of the Sea from all Parts of the World near the Sea, and of it there are two ſorts, that made by Evaporation with Fuel, and that dryed by the Sun, the laſt of which is the ſtrongeſt. The <hi>Sal Gem</hi> is the moſt Penetrating, as appears by its Diſſolving, and Volatilizing Gold, more powerfully than the other.</p>

                  <p>IT is ſuppos'd to be a Bituminous Juice and Roſin of the Earth, ſoft and viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous; for in it we often find Flies, Ants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is call'd <hi>Amber, Succinum, Carabe,</hi> and <hi>Gleſſum.</hi> It is found in the <hi>Perſian Gulph,</hi> on the <hi>Italian Shore;</hi> alſo in the <hi>Currents</hi> near the <hi>Baltick Sea,</hi> in the Dutchy of <hi>Pruſſia.</hi> It is of different Colours, <hi>viz.</hi> White, Yellow and Black: But thoſe who work it into Beads, and other things, make a Diſtinction of twenty or thirty ſorts.</p>
                  <p>The White is moſt eſteem'd in <hi>Phyſical <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe,</hi> as being beſt Digeſted, and of the moſt Odoriferous Smell, containing the greateſt quantity of Volatile Salt. The yellow is next in goodneſs, and moſt valued by the Amber-workers, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of its Tranſparency. The Black is leaſt in eſteem. <hi>Amber,</hi> by agitation, ſends forth an agreeable Smell, and being ground into fine Powder, is given in <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norhea's,</hi> Spitting of Blood, the Bloody Flux, and the Immoderate Flux of the Hemorrhoids, Terms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> alſo to ſtop the Violence of Catarrhs, if the Fume of it be received up the Noſe.</p>
                  <pb n="180" facs="tcp:50560:101"/>
                  <p>It is found in pieces of different ſizes, from the bigneſs of a great Pin's Head, to thoſe of five, ſix, or ſeven Inches Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameter; the greater Pieces are wrought into Cabinets, Cups, and ſeveral Figures, and are valued according to their Big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Tranſparency.</p>
                  <p>That we meet withal in the Shops, is by the Druggiſts generally diſpoſed into two ſorts, by ſeparating the White and Yellow Pieces, from thoſe that are full of Scurf and Black, which they diſtinguiſh by the Names of Fine and Courſe Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: The Fine Levigated is for Phyſical Uſe, and the Courſe for Diſtillation.</p>

                     <head type="sub">Oil, Volatile Salt, and Spirit of Amber.</head>
                     <p>TAke of courſe Amber in fine Powder one Pound, of Tobacco-Pipes, Bricks, Sand, or other Bole, alſo in fine Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, three Pound; mix them well, and with the Mixture fill a Retort half full; ſet it in a Sand Furnace; fit to it a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver (not Luted) make Fire of the firſt Degree for one Hour, increaſe it to the Second, and ſo keep it two Hours; then to the Third, in which keep it four Hours.
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:50560:101"/>In the firſt Degree ſome of the Acid Water we call Spirit, with a little of the fineſt Oil will Diſtil. In the Second, the Spirit and Oil will continue drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, and ſome of its Volatile Salt will riſe into the Neck of the Retort. In the Third, you will elevate more Salt with the Balſamick Oil; and if you will urge the Fire to the Fourth Degree, it will raiſe its thick Balſam. As the Salt riſes into the Neck of the Retort, you ought to ſcrape it out with a clean flat Stick, and put it upon brown Paper to ſuck up the Oil: The Salt, by this means, will be white, and if you deſire it more fine, you may Diſſolve, Filter, and Evaporate it, and you will have a very white Salt. When the Diſtillation is over, and all cool, Separate the Oil and Spirit, by a Funnel, or other Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating Glaſs. If you would Rectifie the Oil, you may put it into a long bodied Retort, and ſet it in Sand, and by gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual raiſing the Fire to the Second De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, there will Diſtil a fine yellow, and clear Oil. But if you would have a pure white, and Aetherial Oil, you muſt put it into a Cucurbit, with three times the quantity of Water to that of Oil, with which the Veſſel muſt not be quite half full, and then fit on the Head and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, and gradually bring up the Fire to the Second Degree, or ſo as to make the Oil and Water bubble, and you will
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:50560:102"/>Diſtil a pure Aetherial Oil, which muſt be ſeparated as before. Separate the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from the Oil left in the Retort, and you will find it Impregnated with ſome of the Salt, and therefore put it into the Receiver, into which you made the Firſt Diſtillation, and ſhake it well, to rinſe out the Salt. Then pour all into a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curbit; fit to it a Head and Receiver; give a gentle Fire to Evaporate the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, till the Drops fall a little Acid; then let it cool, and put it to the Spirit which you ſeparated in the firſt Diſtillation; Rectifie them together, and you have the Spirit of Amber.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Operation</hi> of the Oils, Spirit and Salt, is Diaphoretick and Diuretick.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Doſe</hi> of the Rectify'd Oils is from one to twelve, or fifteen Drops; of the Unrectify'd Oil from one to ſix or ſeven Drops. The <hi>Doſe</hi> of the Spirit is from ten Drops to one Drachm; and that of the Salt from two Grains to one Scruple.</p>
                     <p>The Rectify'd Oil is given in Hyſterical Diſtempers, in the Palſie, Apoplexy, and Epilepſie: The Salt and Spirit is given in the Stone and Gravel in the Kidnies and Bladder, Stoppage of Urine, Ulcers in the Neck of the Bladder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſamick Oil is moſt us'd externally, but of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten given, with good ſucceſs, in old Gleets, a Diſeaſe which frequently puzzles the beſt Phyſicians.</p>

The Fermentation cauſes a Separation of the groſs Tartar, and the Viſcous Parts of the Muſt, from the pure Sulphureous and Oily ones, in which is the Spirit and Eſſential Salt. The petrid Part of the Tartar adheres to the ſides of the Veſſel, and the Viſcous falls to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom.</p>
                  <p>The ſharp ſprightly Wines, ſuch as <hi>Champaigne, Burgundy, Nants, Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux, &amp;c.</hi> being moſt Impregnated with Eſſential Salt, yield more Spirit than Sweet <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> and Muſcate Wines, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are more loaded with a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupical Subſtance.</p>

                     <p>When you put the Extract of Opium to the Tincture of Saffron,<note place="margin">Compound Extract of Opium.</note> Caſtor, and Nutmegs; ſtir them well together till the Extract and Tinctures be Incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and likewiſe be careful to prevent burning the Extract.</p>

                  <p>ESſential Oils are ſuch as retain the Smell and Taſte of the Spices, Gums, Herbs, Flowers, Berries, Seeds and Woods, from which they are drawn, <hi>viz.</hi> Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namon, Cloves, Nutmegs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min, Balſam <hi>Peru,</hi> Ammoniacum, Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banum, Capivii, Turpentine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Mint, Balm, Marjorum, Wormwood, Penny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>royal, Roſemary, Sage, Camomel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Anni-ſeeds, Coriander-ſeeds, Caraway-ſeeds Cumin-ſeeds, Sweet Fennel-ſeeds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Juniper-Berries, Bay-berries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Rhodium, Saſſafras, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <div type="part">
                     <head>The manner of Diſtilling Eſſential Oils.</head>
                     <p>TAke what quantity of any Spice, Gum, Berry, Seed, Herb or Wood you pleaſe, ſuch as are proper to be
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:50560:151"/>bruiſed or powdered, let them be put ſo into a Cooper-Still, and to them put eight or ten times their weight of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Water; Lute the Head to the Still, and its Refrigeratory or Worm, make Fire under it to make it Boil, and in a little time the Water and Oil will run into the Receiver, which we call a Spout Receiver, ſuch as the Figure at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning repreſents; when you apprehend that all the Oil is come off, hold a Spoon under the Noſe of the Worm, and if you perceive any Oil comes with the Water into the Spoon, continue the Fire longer, if no Oil appears in the Spoon, let out the Fire, and ſeparate the Water from the Oil.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Obſerve,</hi> Firſt, Few of theſe Oils are worth Diſtillation, except in great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities, that is to ſay, ſeveral Still fulls.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That you watch it at its firſt beginning to Diſtil, to prevent its boiling over; and if you think the little Stream runs too faſt through the Worm, open the Door of the Fire-hole, and that will a little allay its vigour; if it be not ſufficient, interpoſe, a Fire-ſhovel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Fire, and the bottom of the Alembick, ſo as to keep it running in a ſmall Thred, and after the firſt half Hour of its working, you may be more bold with the Fire.</p>
                     <pb n="278" facs="tcp:50560:152"/>
                     <p>Thirdly, That you leave Water enough in the Still to ſecure the Matter in it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained from burning.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, That you return the Water you Diſtill'd off upon the freſh Matter in the Still, ſo long as it is the ſame Spice, Wood or Herb you drew the firſt Water from; for that Water being fill'd with ſome Oily Particles of the Vegetable from which you drew it, you will have by returning it, more Oil from the ſaid quantity of Wood, Seeds, or Herbs, the Second Diſtillation than you had the Firſt.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Alſo obſerve, That the Oils of Cinnamon, Cloves and Saſſafras, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more Concentrated and Compact than the other, ſink to the bottom of the Water, and all the reſt of the Eſſential Oils ſwim upon the Surface of Water.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, Obſerve, That the Oils of Anni-ſeed, Sweet Fennel-ſeed, and Roſes, will coagulate; therefore you ought ſo to order your Matter towards the latter end of your Diſtillation, to keep the Worm warm to the very Noſe of it, by which means the Coagulated Oil melts down into the Receiver.</p>

                     <head>The Fix'd Salts of Plants are made out of their Aſhes. For Example:</head>
                     <p>Take dry Wormwood, what quantity you pleaſe, burn it upon a clean Hearth; rake the Aſhes ſo long as any Fire appears amongſt them; put thoſe Aſhes into an unglaſed Pan, which ſet in a Calcining Furnace; make Fire about it till the Pan is red hot, where keep it (continually ſtirring the Aſhes) till they are perfectly Calcined into whitiſh gray Aſhes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any blackneſs: Then put them into a clean Pan, and pour hot Water to them; when that Water is ſufficiently Impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated with the Salt, Filter and Evaporate to dryneſs; and ſo continue the Extracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Filteration and Evaporation, till the Aſhes are left inſipid.</p>

                     <p>Its chief Uſe is to ſmooth the Skin, and take away Spots out of the Face. One

                  <p>THE Viper is one of the Reptiles, but whether Animal or Inſect I diſpute not: The Creature is well known, and has a Skin ſcaly, and withal ſo very compact, that it permits little or no Tranſpiration of Spirits, which is the reaſon why it is able to live ſeveral Months without any other Nouriſhment than that of the Air.</p>
                  <p>As to the Story of <hi>Pliny</hi> about their Generation, that the Male puts his Head into the Mouth of the Female, which ſhe bites off; that the young Vipers pierce the Womb and Sides of their Dam, and by that means revenge the Death of their Sire. Of their particular hatred to the Aſh-Tree, that they will rather run in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Fire then come near it, and the like, I reject them as Fabulous.</p>
                  <p>Authors are of different Opinions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the manner of emitting their Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; ſome Aſſerting it proceeds from the yellow Juice which often appears upon

But my deſign being only to give ſuch Antidotes and Medicines as are produc'd from them by Chymical Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, I omit all Diſputes as Foreign to my purpoſe.</p>
